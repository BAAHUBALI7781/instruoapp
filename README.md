# Instruoapp

Whoo boy. Finally got done with this. Only took me what, like *15+* hours? Easy Peasy. I am *totally* not sleep deprived. 
Anyway, let's break it down. 

The backend for this Sexy webapp is entirely written in Node.js. I have used MongoDB as the database.
The app can be run by using the command *node app.js* in the root directory.

****************************WARNING*********************************

There are various packages that I have used in this app. Let's have a look.
1. ***Express***:  Easily the best node.js web framework.
1. ***Mongoose***: Node js package for easier mongoDB database management.
1. ***Passport***: Authentication package (will come back to this a little later)

Rest all are middlewares or helper packages.
